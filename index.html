            <p>"Do not let your difficulties fill you with anxiety; after all it is only in the darkest nights that
                stars
                shine
                more brightly." - Ali Ibn Abi Talib</p>

        <h3>
            <p>"I promise you nothing is as chaotic as it seems. Nothing is worth diminishing your health. Nothing is
                worth
                poisoning yourself into stress, anxiety, and fear." - Steve Maraboli</p>
        </h3>
        <h3>
            <p>"If you can't fly then run, if you can't run then walk, if you can't walk then crawl, but whatever you do
                you
                have to keep moving forward." - Martin Luther King Jr.</p>
