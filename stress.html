    <h2><u>My story</u></h2>
    <h4>
        <p>At the beginning of this year I was quite hopeful and claimed that 2020 would finally be my "year", I even
            had my
            2020 goals written out but was scarpped quickly. As we all know why... From that moment onwards I felt like
            I
            was stuck.
            The new normal was strange getting used to. I was stressed, scared, sleepless, you name it. For weeks I was
            down. I really thought what was the point in doing things. One day, I watched the sunrise and birds fly and
            that
            calmness really was soothing even when I was going through a hard time. I decided I should find a way to
            better
            myself and slowly started to study languages which I love doing but I hadn't studied for awhile. This was my
            way
            of overcoming and getting through. Now I feel much better. This year has been something I've learnt that
            it's
            okay to take time for myslef, not to rush, and whatever happens stressfull or not I will get through it. -
            Zarmeena</p>
