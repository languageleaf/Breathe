            space you are in. As we all know lockdown has been very tough but even with the lock down
            meditation is a key and important to do in our everyday life.

            <p>Notice how your breath goes in and out </p>
            <li><u>Being comfortable and relaxed.</u></li>
            <p>Simply focus on being you, being comfortable in your environment and feeling relaxed and
                care-free.</p>
