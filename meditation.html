        <h2><u>Meditation for Beginners </u></h2>
        <p>When meditating it is very important to feel relaxed and able to feel comfortable in the
            space you are in. As we all know lockdown has been very tough but even with the lock down
            meditation is a key and important to do in our everyday life.

            <p> foucs on your heartbeat. you can use any method with which you feel more comfortable with.
                If you notice your mind thinking, that’s okay, just bring your focus back to your technique.
                When you have completed meditating, it is a good idea to give yourself a few minutes to acclimate slowly
                back into the activities of your day.</p>
                <p>Make sure you choose a time of day that you will not be disturbed. Most people choose early in the morning or late at night. But it really does not matter when you meditate, as long as you can devote a period of time to your practice without being disturbed.<p>
                    <p> lastly it is best to meditate at the same time everyday.</p>
        </ol>

        <p>There are many different types of ways as to how people meditates here are 5 different types people
            mediates:
        </p>

            <li>Yoga</li>
            <li>Reading </li>
        </ol>

        <p>We practice mindfulness so we are able to recognise how our minds are moving everyday. Taking deep
            breaths and finding a relaxing atmosphere is always an important way to ease everything on your
            mind.</p>
            <p> A key thing to remember all the time is that mediation is always a way to help feel safe and relaxed and there many ways in doing so the key is to find what makes you 
                feel comfortable and moving forward with it all the time. Meditation  and drink herbal tea cleanses the mind and soul and makes you feel at peace and calm.  
                 Just find what makes you happy and go through with it and always keep a clear mind and safe space.</p>
